Repository for "Causally constrained reduced-order neural climate emulators via response theory"

Work in progress: the repository will consist in a few notebooks where we explain step by step how to 

(a) identify direct causal links via the FDT and score matching;
(b) enforce the inferred causal structure in neural emulators architectures
